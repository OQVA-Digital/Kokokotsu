## Japan in a pan! 🥟

### https://kokokotsu.co/

Japanese culture has become known world over for its contrast rich blend of modernity and traditionality. Kimonos, tea ceremonies, and thousand year old festivals stand out sharply against hypermodern pop culture; electronic music, cars, cartoons, and computer games—yet when it comes to food we all seem to be stuck on sushi, and maaaaybe some ramen?! Japan has much more to offer than that!
